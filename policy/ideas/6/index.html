            <h3>Detail #6a &mdash; Continued innovation and advancement.</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, it keeps innovation and advancement of society viable. Appropriate compensation is provided to inventors through bid payments and possibly other sources, yet a single entity holds no monopoly, and competition is introduced.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-b"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6b &mdash; Drop in costs for the inventor.</h3>
            <p>Patent offices charge significant fees to fund their patent examination efforts, but that is no longer necessary, so the inventor can experience less risk when finding compensation for their inventions. Moreover, frivolous patent litigation, as well as patent searches (researching the patentability of an invention before prosecuting one), attorney fees, and other costs are all lowered or gone now. <br><br> As another note, the UN could directly fund the WIMP platform and court or rely on the money generated from the rising fees of patent offices of member states.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-c"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6c &mdash; Faster innovation.</h3>
            <p>Since patent examination and similar time-consuming processes are no longer necessary, the rewards can be granted much faster, speeding up the innovation process. Furthermore, instead of waiting several months or years for the details of a patent to be disclosed, disclosure now occurs as soon as a coherent description is formed.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-d"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6d &mdash; Specialization.</h3>
            <p>This new system does not require an inventor to exploit their invention or navigate a complex procedure of licensing their intellectual property, allowing inventors to focus more on innovation. Analogously, manufacturers have the opportunity to focus mainly on producing goods instead of having two separate divisions within their company.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-e"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6e &mdash; Ridding of evergreening and low-quality inventions.</h3>
            <p>Evergreening and low-quality inventions also lose their value. For obvious ideas, businesses are incentivized to report such claims to the WIMP so that they do not need to pay money to do something they already do for free, nor will they be litigated for infringement.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-f"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6f &mdash; Global connectivity for inventions management.</h3>
            <p>International cooperation would also reach new heights. In the current age, patents are filed on a country-by-country basis, but now, the WIMP can enforce and set policies on a global level.</p>
