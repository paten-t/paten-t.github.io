            <p>When an inventor comes up with a novel idea (i.e., what they would patent with a modern patent system), they announce it on the platform, just as they would with a typical patent application. Other businesses registered on the WIMP will then bid for the rights to use this idea.</p>

            <h3>Detail #2a &mdash; Setting a minimum bid.</h3>
            <p>The inventor will set a minimum bid that they feel is appropriate for the ingenuity of their invention. This minimum prevents industries from colluding to lower bids and insufficiently compensating inventors.</p>

            <h3>Detail #2b &mdash; Bidding procedure.</h3>
            <p>The WIMP would need to specify the bidding procedure. For instance, the bidding might be open and iterative &mdash; in other words, all bids would be publicly recorded, and businesses would be allowed to adjust their bids as they see fit. <br><br> The bidding duration would probably be a set period, for example, two weeks.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-c"></div>
            <h3>Detail #2c &mdash; Novelty within claims.</h3>
            <p>Inventors need not refrain from disclosing the novel aspects of their invention as they would with a patent; usually, patent applicants choose to keep their invention confidential from the public. <br><br> This is often done to prevent the disclosure from being considered prior art and invalidating their patent. Furthermore, they might be worried that another company will steal their invention and exploit it while their patent is pending (parents often take years to be granted). However, neither concern is valid with this new system, as companies do not care about prior art, and the time until monopoly is much shorter, meaning there is no time to exploit an invention before it becomes protected. <br><br> Furthermore, because an invention is disseminated as soon as it is realized, scientific progress is accelerated instead of requiring delays of several years.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-d"></div>
            <h3>Detail #2d &mdash; Objectivity and the loss of useless bids.</h3>
            <p>Since the market pays for their monopolies, erroneous monopolies are not granted recklessly. <br><br> Previously, a poorly funded patent office might have granted them, caring only about the fees to extract. In addition, there is no cost for a patent office to issue a patent. <br><br> However, now, businesses must pay money to win the bid, so they have an incentive not to bid for inventions that already fall within the public domain. Indeed, if a claim is not quite an invention at all, i.e., an obvious idea, then because all claims are transparent, the public can complain to the WIMP to stop the bidding and monopoly from proceeding. <br><br> For the same reasons, decisions are no longer as subjective; there are no longer semantic arguments over the meaning of prior art, whether a business wants to bid or does not, but in either case, their decisions are based on the prospective future of their business.</p>

            <h3>Detail #2e &mdash; Further incentives.</h3>
            <p>Governments or organizations, not necessarily for-profit businesses, can also bid. For example, if, someday, a person dreams up a new method for planting coral reefs to combat climate change, there might be little demand for that innovation and thus no reason to patent it. <br><br> However, governments might find this idea practical in protecting their citizens from tropical storms or boosting a local industry, and they would now have an incentive to pay to be able to use this innovation, with no risk to the inventor. Other examples include space agencies &mdash; for example, NASA spent (adjusted for inflation) several hundred billion US dollars on its 20th century space programs. <br><br> Furthermore, the UN or other organizations or governments might award prizes to inventors for outstanding inventions as further incentives.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-f"></div>
            <h3>Detail #2f &mdash; Choice between bidding and a simple payment model.</h3>
            <p>It should be noted that a simple payment model is an alternative to bidding. While bidding allows the market and each company to value an invention separately, bidding may also limit competition if too few are permitted to utilize the invention.</p>
