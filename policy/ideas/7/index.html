            <h3>Detail #7a &mdash; Precedent in the writing and publishing industry.</h3>
            <p>One significant precedent is the writing and publishing industry. Most authors choose not to publish their books because of the necessary costs and experience but instead let a well-respected and established publishing company do the work. <ul><li>Authors no longer need to devote much time to printing or promoting their books and can return to writing. The same would be true for inventors. Many inventors would now be able to specialize in research and development rather than manufacturing. Furthermore, there is often much stigma associated with self-publishing, as they no longer need to go through rigorous editing and proofreading. Indeed, specialization and separation would keep industries from being lax with regulation.</li><li>In addition, different publishers can often service separate regions of the world, each tailored specifically for a target audience. For example, foreign publishers might buy translation rights to sell to a new market. The same model could also be applied here, with different bid winners having different products incorporating the same inventions.</li><li>In addition, authors do not compete with each other to write a book. There are likely tens of thousands of books written about World War II, yet authors are not competing with other authors and do not complain of other authors as driving down sales. Inventors should be the same, each cooperating with others to add to the industry, just as authors add to the literature.</li><li>Authors also might disclose book ideas long before they are written, and the same should be able to happen with inventions. Instead of waiting for a patent to be granted, inventors should be able to disclose their invention as soon as they come up with it, without delay.</li><li>Generally, authors submit just a manuscript, not the finished product. For example, only a tiny fraction of authors illustrate cover art for their books, instead leaving it to the publishing company. In the same fashion, inventors would provide only the ideas and inventions, while it would be up to manufacturers to incorporate them into complete products.</li><li>It may also be noted that authors and publishers can often work together, so although cooperation between inventors and winners might be difficult for very complex technologies, they might try to model the former system in solving those difficulties.</li><li>Finally, publishers often pay authors to be able to publish (an advance), and this mimics the bidding process.</li></ul></p>

            <h3>Detail #7b &mdash; Precedent in the auto industry.</h3>
            <p>Another precedent is with car manufacturers, who traditionally do not sell their cars. This rule allows dealers to perfect the consumer side while manufacturers perfect the manufacturing.</p>

            <h3>Detail #7c &mdash; Precedent in scientific research.</h3>
            <p>This system may also draw parallels to scientific research. Many often publish on a payroll, simply sharing results as they please. A similar payment system would be in place for the inventors on the WIMP, who only share results but do not necessarily work on their ideas; instead, other businesses subsidize their work, just as a payroll finances scientific research.</p>

            <h3>Detail #7d &mdash; Precedent in investing and stock trading.</h3>
            <p>The evaluation of innovation may also be seen with investors and stock traders. They also need to determine the amount they are willing to pay for novel ideas, so, hopefully, finding an appropriate bid price will not be too difficult.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-e"></div>
            <h3>Detail #7e &mdash; Precedent in commons-based peer production.</h3>
            <p>Other systems utilize commons-based peer production &mdash; when many people collaborate on a shared resource. For example, Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation, the Open Dictionary Project, and SETI@home all allow for collaboration on massive platforms, with social norms to prevent fraud. Indeed, a vital component of these is modularity &mdash; one person does not do all the work, but there is instead a collaborative environment, which is why many have been so successful.</p>

            <h3>Detail #7f &mdash; Precedent in bridge.</h3>
            <p>Finally, the card game of bridge is somewhat similar. There is bidding, after which the bid winner gets a dummy &mdash; the term for the partner of the winner, who reveals their cards. This dummy is akin to the inventor, who does not play or manufacture but instead offers something for the winner to use.</p>
