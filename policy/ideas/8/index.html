            <h3>Detail #8a &mdash; Corporate opposition.</h3>
            <p>At the moment, it seems reasonable that PAEs and NPEs would strongly oppose this proposal. For many of those corporations, it would take away their only source of revenue. <br><br> This is because they have nothing to gain and everything to lose. In addition, by definition, PAEs and NPEs have much legal influence and will be quick to sue, so any proposed legislation will be grueling and slow. <br><br> Furthermore, other companies might wish for the current system to stay in place simply for convenience. <br><br> To address these issues, it would be necessary to maintain an informed and slow phase-in to minimize inconvenience. Moreover, public relations and collaboration with key industries to write compromising legislation will help. It would also help to review other pieces of legislation that have found their way through corporate opposition (e.g., the Patent Act of 1952, the America Invents Act, TRIPS, TPP, and many more). Finally, the WIMP could provide training and resources to countries and companies to navigate the new system in cooperation with regional governments.</p>

            <h3>Detail #8b &mdash; Job loss.</h3>
            <p>Patent examiners, attorneys and agents, consultants, administrators, and other employees working with patents might lose their jobs. Thus, a very gradual introduction of the new system would help these workers continue to make a living while others slowly transition away from these jobs. Furthermore, they could also advise or serve on the new system.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-c"></div>
            <h3>Detail #8c &mdash; Lack of international cooperation.</h3>
            <p>This new system would require significant cooperation between countries. Patents allow each country to maintain sovereignty and control over its intellectual property. This fact may complicate matters, and perhaps concessions will need to be made. For example, governments might censor claims on the platform originating from their own country.</p>
