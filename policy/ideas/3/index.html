            <h3>Detail #3a &mdash; Number of winners.</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the inventor will choose the number of winners to admit based on the number of collaborators they are willing to accept, although it is also possible that in the new system, the WIMP will simply set a default value. Regardless, this number should be at least two to create competition.</p>

            <h3>Detail #3b &mdash; Binding bidding.</h3>
            <p>Bidding is binding to prevent companies from simply raising bid prices to harm their competitors. Bids are usually binding in auctions, for example.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-c"></div>
            <h3>Detail #3c &mdash; Possibility of no bids.</h3>
            <p>If, in the end, there are no bids, the claim simply dies, with the inventor not receiving any compensation. However, no monopoly is granted either because the market believes the idea is not applicable. On the other hand, if the inventor still believes the invention has merit, they can form their own business to hold a patent monopoly, but only if they agree to pay the WIMP the minimum bid they set once their monopoly expires. <br><br> This option allows genuinely good ideas, even those not recognized by the market, to find success. However, it also discourages inventors from setting an arbitrarily large minimum bid to prevent bidding and taking the monopoly for themselves.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-d"></div>
            <h3>Detail #3d &mdash; Contract for the use of the invention.</h3>
            <p>The inventors and winners will then sign a contract to record the agreement between the inventor and the winners as a collective, which will be publicly available through the WIMP platform, and the WIMP court will have the jurisdiction to settle disagreements. Within this contract will be instructions for how the bid will be paid, which need not be upfront, as, for significant inventions, winners will likely not be able to afford their bids. In addition, the contract might specify other points, such as <ul><li>if the invention is complicated, cooperation between the inventor and various winners might be necessary, so the contract might outline the roles of all parties,</li><li>agreements for profit sharing,</li><li>or a provision that encourages market segmentation or differentiation to prevent market saturation.<ul><li>For example, one winner might sell to America and another to Europe or sell cheaper versions while the other has pricier options.</li><li>This will often be necessary if the winners are all working with the same invention at around the same time, leading to the potential for the market to be flooded with a series of similar products and making it hard for consumers to choose one specific one.</li></li>This would mean that winners would need to compete with each other to sell the same product, and with wasted resources and a loss of profitability, this would be a lose-lose situation for all.<li></ul></p>

            <h3>Detail #3e &mdash; Specialization is another benefit and precedent.</h3>
            <p>Since this system works best with inventors and producers being separate entities, it allows for both to specialize. For example, instead of a business trying to handle both the creation of new ideas while simultaneously marketing and manufacturing their existing ones, they can specialize in just one aspect of the supply chain, allowing businesses to become more efficient.</p>
