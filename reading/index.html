        <h1>What are <i>patents</i>?</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><b>Patents are a method of managing intellectual property, designed to reward innovation. The idea is that, without patents, no one would choose to innovate.</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When an inventor develops a patentable idea (for example, a new design for a light bulb), they apply for a patent (patent prosecution) to their local patent office. The patent office will then check their patent against ideas that are already known to the public (prior art), and if this patent is truly novel, it is granted, and the inventor receives a patent monopoly.</li>
          <li>A patent monopoly guarantees that, for some time (usually 20 years), the inventor may prevent (patent litigation) any other business that attempts to exploit the patented idea (patent infringement) commercially.</li>
          <li>There are three types of patents &mdash; utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. Utility patents are for inventions, while design patents are for ornamental designs of functional items. Plant patents, on the other hand, are reserved for distinct and new varieties of plants that have been asexually reproduced.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Utility patents account for approximately 90% of filed patents. Since they are also the ones that protect inventions and are the basis for most problems that plague the patent system, they will be the main focus of this project.</li>
            <li>For the other two, they might either be kept in place or join utility patents in the new system, but either option is acceptable.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="inner">
        <h1>Patent Benefits</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><i>Although we would like to reform the system for managing patents, we must first acknowledge that patents have real benefits for the economy.</i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Since novel ideas are rewarded with monopolies, it encourages inventors to take risks, invest resources, and push the boundaries of what is possible; patents make it easier to turn a profit. They also attract investors, who are more likely to support startups if they know that there is a patent protecting their investment. This access to funding enables inventors to bring their ideas to fruition.</li>
          <li>In exchange for their monopoly, patent holders must publicly disclose their invention, allowing innovation to spread.</li>
          <li>In addition, patents not only protect invention, they spur the transformation of concepts into tangible, marketable realities.</li>
          <li>Finally, patents are granted to the first inventor who files for a patent (first-to-file rule), encouraging speedy innovation (patent races).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="inner">
        <h1>Patent Problems</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><i>However, as with any system that includes the word monopoly, we can expect some issues that arise from the modern patent system.</i></p>
        <h2>High Prices and Monopoly</h2>
        <p>By design, a patent allows a company to exclude competitors in a particular market. Exclusion leads to monopolization and prices that would be higher than what would be possible in a competitive marketplace. In other words, the consumer is subsidizing the research and development process (R&amp;D).</p>
        <p>Other issues associated with monopolies are also present, such as</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>reduced consumer choices,</li>
        	<li>inefficiencies,</li>
        	<li>lack of further innovation,</li>
        	<li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Patent Trolling</h2>
        <p>Patent trolling is the abuse of patent litigation for money without also advancing the state of the economy.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Because of the legal costs and complexities associated with patents, small businesses are often dissuaded or downright prevented from entering the market.
          	<ul>
          		<li>For example, a large company might threaten small businesses with patent infringement, telling them to purchase a license or else face patent infringement lawsuits, in the hope that this might convince a purchase or prevent competition. This practice is known as a chilling effect.</li>
          		<li>Companies that do so are often named a patent assertion entity (PAE) &mdash; a company that acquires patents for the sole purpose of suing other companies over infringement, or a non-practicing entity (NPE) &mdash; a company that does not produce any products or services and instead generates revenue exclusively through litigation.</li>
          	</ul>
        	</li>
        	<li>In addition, patent thickets occur when many patents cover a single technology, and navigating each becomes a challenge.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Meaningless Patents</h2>
        <p>Meaningless patents are ways for corporations to extend their monopoly without making meaningful improvements.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Although patent monopolies are, in most countries, capped at 20 years, evergreening a patent &mdash; applying for a new patent of a tiny change, even if, say, the product remains indistinguishable &mdash; can extend it further.</li>
        	<li>This low standard means that companies need not actively continue to innovate but only need to make barely noticeable changes that would be obvious to anyone in the industry.</li>
        	<li>There are also overly broad patents, where the claims of patents are deliberately vague. These allow bad actors to initiate patent litigation without requiring real innovation before the fact. For illustration, imagine that the invention of the wheel was patented. Then, although its original purpose was&nbsp;to aid in transportation, a patent holder might claim that the windmill, invented later, infringes upon the original patent. This hinders innovation and would have prevented the development of the windmill.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lack of International Standardization and Cooperation</h2>
        <p>Attempts have been made to globalize and unify the patent system, but there is still no there is no global enforcement of patents, as they are territorial rights. This means that an inventor could file a patent in the US, and a business in China could legally exploit the patented information for commercial purposes, because no patent was filed in China (unless the item was imported into the US). This can lead to duplication, where inventors seek patents in multiple jurisdictions, wasting time, money, and effort navigating the multifarious patent landscape of different territories.</p>
        <h2>Delayed Patent Disclosure</h2>
        <p>The modern patent system incentives delayed public disclosure, which means innovation spreads slower.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In other words, inventors will generally not disclose their invention to the public as soon as it is developed.
	          <ul>
		          <li>Firstly, it is hard to modify a patent that has already been filed, so inventors have a chance of missing out on something big. For example, they might see a new application of their invention only after prosecution but can no longer claim it as well.</li>
		          <li>The timing of patents may also be chosen to coincide with trends or market demand to maximize the potential and relevance of their invention when it enters the market.</li>
		          <li>In addition, patent monopolies may be lengthened if filed later.</li>
	          </ul>
	        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cost, Time, and Reasons Why</h2>
        <p>In a majority of localities, the cost of patenting is sky-high in terms of expenditure and time. In addition, there is currently a patent backlog in many places around the world. The reason for this is often because the nature of patent examination is inherently subjective; determining whether a patent is novel is difficult.</p>

        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><i>Patent reform is necessary. Here are some random statistics and examples that support this claim.</i></p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3756359">Prices drop by approximately 8&ndash;10% following patent expiry.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/133509/download">However, for pharmaceutical drugs, a poster child of patent abuse, this drop may be over 95% in some cases.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.cidsa.org/publications/xcenda-summary">Indeed, relating to costly medication, researchers attribute between 112,000 and 125,000 deaths a year to patients who fail to take necessary medications because they cannot afford them.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/history/patents/ed_inc.htm">It took Edison around twelve weeks, during the holiday season, to be granted his patent for the revolutionary light bulb. Now, that time would be anywhere between three to five years, not including the time during which a patent is challenged in court or litigated for potential infringement.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1tc166q2">The average cost for a patent, is approximately ten thousand to thirty thousand US dollars, but this may easily skyrocket to millions of dollars if a patent is challenged or litigated.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1093/213230/20220203143527970_21-%20Petition%20for%20Writ.pdf">According to the US Supreme Court, <i>rulings on patent eligibility have become so diverse and unpredictable as to have a serious effect on the innovation incentive in all fields of technology</i>.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/technology/apple-samsung-trial-highlights-patent-wars.html">The smartphone is protected by as many as 250,000 patents.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.287.5460.1933">Even for the most complicated patents, at most 30 hours are given to a patent examiner to review the patent, an outrageously short time that leads to the erroneous granting of patents. In most case, the time allocated is much fewer.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/patent-assertion-entity-activity-ftc-study">96% of all patent infringement lawsuits come from PAEs.</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1677785">Less than 1% of defendants in patent troll suits are found to have actually infringed on a valid patent.</a></li>

        <h1 id="existing-ideas">Preexisting Ideas</h1>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><b>For further reading, you might take a look at realistic ideas that have been suggested by experts. These ideas are mostly on the smaller end, specific to the patent systems of certain countries (usually the US), and do not address many of the other issues in one fell swoop, as this proposal tries to do.</b></p>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><b>However, these are still worth delving into. Perhaps, you might find that aspects of one might fit into the other, to strengthen them both. Or, it might be interesting to see how past legislation incorporating these ideas has passed, and how those same methods of winning over the opposition could be applied to this policy.</b></p>
        <p style="font-size:1.25em"><b>These ideas can be split roughly into three categories, based on the stage of a patent that they refer to &mdash; patent prosecution, patent examination and review, and patent monopolies.</b></p>
        <h2>Patent Prosecution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Many call for stricter regulations on patent prosecution. One point of contention is with prophetic examples.
            <ul>
              <li>Patents are required to be enabling, i.e., one skilled in the art must be able to make and use the invention as defined by the claim(s) of the particular patent. This ensures that the patent is meaningfully communicated, and does not require further undue experimentation.</li>
              <li>However, one method of dealing with this requirement is to give a prophetic example. In other words, the prosecutor presents a plausible, but not necessarily realized, embodiment of the invention. Prophetic examples are used to illustrate that an invention is not merely a theoretical concept, but that it can be put into practice with a reasonable expectation of success.</li>
              <li>For example, when Edison first invented the light bulb to light a room, he could have included, as a prophetic example, that light bulbs could be integrated, and be remotely controlled with voice commands, even, for example, synchronizing to music.</li>
              <li>However, one problem with prophetic examples is that they are hard to distinguish from normal examples, and this may lead to confusion or what might be seen as a limitation of the scope of a patent.</li>
              <li>Thus, one idea is to require clear labeling of prophetic examples, although another is to eliminate them entirely, as they do not necessarily serve the requirement of enablement.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Another idea is extending the grace period for patents.
            <ul>
              <li>A grace period is some time (usually around 6 to 12 months) during which an inventor can privately disclose their invention without it being considered prior art.</li>
              <li>Extending the grace period may allow inventors greater opportunity to raise funds for costly patents, or to attract investors to ensure that they have a use in patent prosecution.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Yet a third, that has already passed, is limiting each patent to just one invention. This helps prevent overly broad patents.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Patent Examination and Review</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>One idea is to have open prior art databases. This would allow inventors to determine, by reviewing prior art, if their invention is novel, without needing to first file an application and pay fees. This would also help keep patent examiner decisions objective, coherent, and prevent erroneous granting and later appeals.</li>
          <li>Another is to allow AI to assist in patent examination and finding prior art. This would expedite patent prosecution.</li>
          <li>A third idea relating to patent litigation is to set a higher bar for initiating a case, possibly preventing baseless patent litigation.
            <ul>
              <li>However, it is unclear how this might be carried out. In addition, there would be corporate pushback from PAEs and NPEs, who live to oppose this sort of thing.</li>
              <li>On the other hand, it might be possible to rid the need for patent litigation in its entirety. Instead of costly patent litigation cases, there are options for a Post-grant Review (PGR), Inter Partes Review (IPR), or Covered Business Method (CBM). These are shorter than patent litigation, because they are specialized processes administered by experts, without juries, and have fewer possibilities for appeal, all to match the reality of patent cases, which are different from normal civil suits. These can lead to quicker and more cost-effective disputes.</li>
              <li>Yet, PGRs and the other options are rare, as they often have a time-limitation, i.e., a challenger can only initiate a review 9 months after granting. One proposal is to expand these options, to further take away from litigation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Finally, it has been proposed that there should be greater enforcement of the various principles that govern patentable ideas, and how to file a patent. Enforcement has often been lax, as seen with the unreasonable number of patents granted erroneously.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Patent Monopoly</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A first idea is to increase transparency in patent ownership. Currently, if a patent changes hands, there is no requirement that this transfer must be recorded. However, this may cause confusion and lead to patent trolls hiding their identities.</li>
          <li>A second is to have uniform patent duration in certain industries.
            <ul>
              <li>For industries with significant regulation, e.g., the pharmaceutical industry, patents are prosecuted before clinical trials, and this means that the effective patent monopoly will actually be shorter. Thus, there have been attempts to account for this, by extending the patent monopoly by half the length of the clinical trials period for pharmaceutical drugs, but this is often not enough, and should also apply to other industries.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Patent monopolies could also be replaced with patent pools.
            <ul>
              <li>Patent pools are agreements between parties to cross-license (share) their patents. This often occurs when multiple patents cover different essential aspects of a technology, and only through wielding them combined may anything useful result.</li>
              <li>This can increase innovation while also cutting costs. Patent pools also promote competition, because, to enter a patent pool, multiple companies need to have been working on a product.</li>
              <li>Patent pools might also help develop industry standards, if multiple sectors offer their input on the best structures. For example, all our devices use the same sort of network to communicate, and this is a product of the Wi-Fi patent pool.</li>
              <li>However, this borders on antitrust violations (excluding new entrants into the industry, raising prices, collusion, etc.). It is also complex to negotiate and administer patent pools. Finally, companies might withhold patents, and then litigate, violating the spirit of the pool.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Another is to limit the assignment (selling of) a patent, as this is often what leads to PAEs or NPEs.</li>
          <li>Finally, there has been mention of prizes as an alternative reward for patents.
            <ul>
              <li>This prevents monopolies while still rewarding an inventor with a prize.</li>
              <li>Furthermore, PAEs and NPEs can no longer turn a profit, so they vanish with this new model.</li>
              <li>However, there are some issues.
                <ul>
                  <li>Who determines the prize amount? Some inventions are inherently more valuable than others, so how would that be decided fairly?</li>
                  <li>Who pays for the prizes? Prizes might come from taxpayer money, but that would be counterproductive, and it would be hard for countries to agree to these changes, just as with funding for essential collaboration, such as climate change.</li>
                  <li>A patent makes it necessary to commercialize an invention and create a working product that benefits the world, but this is not true with prizes. In addition, the lack of competition further increases the ability to experiment and pursue finer details.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
