        <p>Establishing a UN specialized agency.</p>

            <p>The first course of action will be to establish a <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/specialized-agencies">UN specialized agency</a> to handle the new international system for managing inventions. <br><br> A possible name for this agency might be the World Inventions Management Programme (WIMP), although this is entirely arbitrary and might be subject to change. <br><br> This agency will be tasked with administering a platform whereby the sharing of inventions will take place. In addition, the agency will handle all disputes that relate to this new system.</p>

            <h3>Detail #1a &mdash; ECOSOC.</h3>
            <p>This agency will likely fall into <a href="https://www.un.org/ecosoc/en/home">Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)</a>. ECOSOC also manages organizations such as the WHO, UNICEF, WFP, and others. These have a history of promoting and allowing international collaboration, which would hopefully be true with WIMP.</p>

            <h3>Detail #1b &mdash; Collaboration with other entities.</h3>
            <p>The agency will collaborate with (what would previously have been) local patent offices. <br><br> This will help increase connectivity and engagement on the platform. For example, office workers might assist inventors and other businesses, i.e., by helping them transition or use the new system, working with legal matters, filing documents, or other tasks. <br><br> Furthermore, this keeps many patent workers in jobs relating to intellectual property and inventions, preventing the job loss that will inevitably result from a massive overhaul of any system.</p>

            <h3>Detail #1d &mdash; Judicial proceedings and the WIMP court.</h3>
            <p>The WIMP will establish a court to arbitrate all disputes that arise from interactions on the WIMP platform. The WIMP will assemble a pool of independent experts to staff this court. A semi-random panel of three experts will be selected for each dispute, with care taken to prevent conflicts of interest. They will first determine if the matter is worth a trial (at least one of the three experts must express their belief). If the case proceeds, the panel will be allowed to perform all the normal operations of a court and settle the matter. Settling the matter may involve restricting an entity's access to the WIMP platform or calling upon a nation or international organization, such as the World Trade Organization, to take action against that entity. It also happens that a specialized court could also lead to several benefits over the traditional method of settling litigation or other patent-related cases, just as many countries have tried implementing specialized pathways for patent reviews (e.g., post-grant reviews in the US). <ul><li>Firstly, the panel will be staffed with experts with experience dealing with these cases, allowing for a speedy trial.</li><li>In addition, the panel can be chosen to have no relation to any countries where the various entities reside, adding to the impartiality.</li><li>Furthermore, there would be no real appeal process, and so this would prevent cases from dragging on for years, as patent litigation cases do.</li><li>As another point, instead of the unilateral decision to litigate with the modern system, there now needs to be consensus to challenge (as mentioned later), and that may help prevent frivolous patent litigation cases.</li><li>Finally, there might also be complaint mechanisms and ethics boards to review and audit decisions and to ensure fairness.</li></ul></p>
