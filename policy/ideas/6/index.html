            <h3>Detail #6a &mdash; Continued innovation and advancement.</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, it keeps innovation and advancement of society viable. Appropriate compensation is provided to inventors through bid payments and possibly other sources, yet a single entity holds no monopoly, and competition is introduced.</p>
          </section>

          <section>

            <h3>Detail #6b &mdash; Drop in costs for the inventor.</h3>
            <p>Patent offices charge significant fees to fund their patent examination efforts, but that is no longer necessary, so the inventor can experience less risk when finding compensation for their inventions. Moreover, frivolous patent litigation, as well as patent searches (researching the patentability of an invention before prosecuting one), attorney fees, and other costs are all lowered or gone now. <br><br> As another note, the UN could directly fund the WIMP platform and court or rely on the money generated from the rising fees of patent offices of member states.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-c"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6c &mdash; Faster innovation.</h3>
            <p>Since patent examination and similar time-consuming processes are no longer necessary, the rewards can be granted much faster, speeding up the innovation process. Furthermore, instead of waiting several months or years for the details of a patent to be disclosed, disclosure now occurs as soon as a coherent description is formed.</p>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-d"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6d &mdash; Specialization.</h3>
            <p>This new system does not require an inventor to exploit their invention or navigate a complex procedure of licensing their intellectual property, allowing inventors to focus more on innovation. Analogously, manufacturers have the opportunity to focus mainly on producing goods instead of having two separate divisions within their company.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-e"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6e &mdash; Ridding of evergreening and low-quality inventions.</h3>
            <p>Evergreening and low-quality inventions also lose their value. For obvious ideas, businesses are incentivized to report such claims to the WIMP so that they do not need to pay money to do something they already do for free, nor will they be litigated for infringement.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-f"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6f &mdash; Global connectivity for inventions management.</h3>
            <p>International cooperation would also reach new heights. In the current age, patents are filed on a country-by-country basis, but now, the WIMP can enforce and set policies on a global level.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <div style="margin-top:-80px;margin-bottom:80px" id="detail-g"></div>
            <h3>Detail #6g &mdash; Incentives.</h3>
            <p>It is also a good idea to inspect the balance of incentives in this new system. Although a system that maximizes the reward for innovation is nice, the system should also prevent useless inventions from protection. <br><br> While this system is not perfect, it does do more to prevent the rewarding of useless inventions. Many patents have been granted with seemingly no reason, but businesses will not make decisions that jeopardize their future. <br><br> Furthermore, inventors really are incentivized to invent and disseminate their ideas on the platform, regardless of the size of their invention. For small ideas, with a small potential for revenue, then with patents, they might not even break even from the application fees. However, now, inventors have nothing to lose. <br><br> In addition, for big ideas, where success is guaranteed, as long as the inventor sets a high enough minimum bid, and as long as the idea is described in enough detail to fully depict the potential, the inventor will generally enjoy a huge profit, worthy of their invention. <br><br> On the other hand, there is one slight caveat. It is possible that businesses in a certain industry collude and say <i>if an inventor sets a minimum price above 1,000,000 USD (or some other suitably high value), no business shall bid for it.</i> This forces inventors to either pay the million dollars or give up on their invention, after which its use is not protected; moreover, after a first precedent, other inventors would know to set a low minimum price, or else be left without bids. However, such abuse of the system would be easy to spot, and the WIMP court would handle the antitrust investigations. Furthermore, this practice would be unsustainable for industries that rely on outside innovation, as inventors would no longer be incentivized to develop ideas for this industry.</p>
